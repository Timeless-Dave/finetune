She already has  dog walkers employed, and today there are  dogs that need to be walked. Each dog walker can walk multiple dogs at the same time, so the dogs will be arranged into \nnonempty groups, and each group will then be walked by a single dog walker. However, smaller dogs can be aggressive towards larger dogs, and that makes it harder to walk them together.\nMore formally, if the smallest dog in a group has size , and the largest dog in the group has size , then the range of the group is deﬁned as . In particular, the range of a group consisting of a single dog is . The smaller the range of a group is, the\neasier it is to walk that particular group. Hence Alice would like to distribute the dogs among the dog walkers so that the sum of ranges of the groups is minimized. Also, since she doesn't want any of the dog walkers to feel left out, she makes sure each\ndog walker gets to walk at least one dog.\nGiven ,  and the sizes of the dogs, can you help Alice determine what is the minimum sum of ranges over the  groups if the dogs are arranged optimally?\nStandard input\nThe ﬁrst line of input contains , , which gives the number of test cases.\nEach test case starts with a line containing two integers , the number of dogs, and , the number of employees, separated by a single space. Then  lines follow, one for each dog, containing an integer  representing the size of the corresponding\ndog.\nStandard output\nFor each test case, you should output, on a line by itself, the minimum sum of ranges over the  groups if the dogs are arranged optimally.\nConstraints and notes\nInput Output Explanation\n2\n4 2\n3\n5\n1\n1\n5 4\n30\n40\n20\n41\n502\n1In the ﬁrst test case there are four dogs: one of size , one of size , and two of\nsize . There are two dog walkers, and we want to distribute the dogs among\nthem. One optimal way to do this is to make one dog walker walk the dogs of size\n and , and the other dog walker walk the two dogs of size . Then the ﬁrst\ngroup has range , while the second group has range , giving\na total of .\nIn the second test case there are dogs of size , , ,  and , and four dog\nwalkers. There are so many dog walkers that we can ask all but one of them to\nwalk a single dog. We will make the last dog walker walk the dogs of size  and\n, which gives a range of .

For its next generation of Operating Systems, Wintel decided to change the page replacement algorithm from First-In-First-Out (FIFO) to Least Recently Used (LRU) in order to improve\nthe performance. In an OS, page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out (swap out, write to disk) when a page of memory needs to be allocated.\nIn a FIFO page replacement, the OS keeps track of all the pages in memory in a queue, with the most recent arrival at the back, and the oldest arrival in front. When a page needs to be replaced, the page at the front of the queue (the oldest page) is selected.\nIn a LRU page replacement, the OS maintains a list containing all the pages in memory. At the back of this list is the least recently used page and at the front is the most recently used page. Whenever a new page is accessed, the OS checks if the page is present in the list or not. If the page is listed, the page is moved to the front of the list. If the\npage is not listed, then the OS would evict the least recently used page from the list and add the new page to the front of the list.\nDr. X is excited by the prospect of improved performance for LRU page replacement so that he can advertise the improved performance of his applications. But Dr. X is aware of the fact that not all of his applications will get a performance boost because of the change. So he has hired you to develop a program to determine if an application can be\nadvertised or not. Your program will monitor the various data accesses by the application and should determine the number of times that the pages will have to be replaced. If the number of page replacements with the LRU page replacement algorithm is less than with the FIFO page replacement algorithm, then Dr. X will be able to advertise the\napplication.\nStandard input\nThe input begins with an integer , which gives the number of test cases in the input.\nEach test case begins with a line containing three space-separated integers ,  and , where  is the number of pages present in the OS for a program,  is the size of each page and  is the number of memory accesses by the application.\nThe next  lines will contain the various addresses accessed by the application.\nNote: In order to solve this challenge, you will need to identify the page that corresponds to the addresses listed. The page number is given by the formula .\nStandard output\nFor each test case, you should output a single line with three space-separated values:\nThe ﬁrst value should be either yes or no: If the application can be advertised, then the output should be yes. If not, the output should be no.\nThe second value should be the number of page replacements under the FIFO page replacement approach.\nThe last value should be the number of page replacements under the LRU page replacement approach.\nConstraints and notes\n and  will always be a power of \nThe memory addresses range from  to , inclusive\nInput Output Explanation\n2\n4 1024 5\n0\n1024\n2048\n3076\n4096\n2 128 7\n0\n255\n127\n256\n60\n1024\n120no 1 1\nyes 3 2For the ﬁrst test case, there are only four pages which can be allocated and the size of each page is  bytes.\nThe addresses , , ,  and  correspond to the th, st, nd, rd and th page.\nThe page replacements are shown with asterisks (*) in the following tables.\nFIFO Page Replacement:\nLRU Page Replacement:\nBoth LRU and FIFO page replacement algorithm have  page replacement.

He has chosen to grow his trees at this location mainly because Troodos mountain has a continuous source of fresh water for watering the trees. The water captured\non the slopes, at high altitudes, ﬂows under gravity via the stream and it is stored and distributed through an underground network of water pipes and water pumps.\nUnfortunately, earlier this morning, Pantelis noticed that the ﬂow of water from the water pump in his ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly reduced, and this will severely aﬀect this season’s crop of lemons. Watering lemon trees is tricky. Too little or too much\nwater and the tree will die. You should never let a lemon tree dry out completely for more than a day. Pantelis suspects that one of the water pumps on the channel has malfunctioned causing the water shortage. He needs to immediately\ndetermine which pump ma lfunctioned, notify maintenance in order to get it ﬁxed and re-establish the regular water ﬂow to his trees. Since the water runs in underground pipes he has no way of knowing if the ﬂow is reduced in the pipes. He\nneeds to climb the mountain and methodically check each of the water pumps for shortage in water levels in order to ﬁgure out which one is damaged.\nThere are  water pumps evenly set apart along the network, with the ﬁrst one (last in the ﬂow line) being located at Pantelis’s ﬁeld. Pantelis knows that his pump is working properly. All the pumps ranging from the damaged pump down to\nPantelis’s pump are having water shortage. It takes Pantelis  minutes to get to the next pump on the mountain (uphill or downhill) and  minutes to check the pump for water shortage.\nPantelis needs to minimize the time needed to ﬁnd the damaged water pump. Therefore, your program should ﬁnd a plan to minimize the time to ﬁnd the damaged water pump in the worst case scenario.\nStandard input\nThe input consists of three space-separated integers ,  and .  is the total number of water pumps on the network. Pantelis pump is number .  is the time it takes Pantelis to travel to the next pump of the network (uphill or downhill),\nand  is the number of minutes it takes to check if a water pump is having water shortage.\nStandard output\nThe output consists of a single integer. The minimum worst-case time to ﬁnd the damaged water pump.\nConstraints and notes\nInput Output Explanation\n4 1 2 7 There are four water pumps on the channel. Pantelis’s pump is number 1 and it\nhas water shortage.\nEach of the pumps has  and . Pantelis needs one minute to\nreach the next pump in line and he needs two minutes to check each pump for\nwater shortage. Pantelis checks pump 3 ﬁrst. If it does not have water\nshortage, it means that pump 2 is the damaged one and he does not need to\ncheck water pump 4 (total time = 4). If water pump 3 has water shortage, then\nPantelis will check water pump 4 next. If water pump 4 does not have water\nshortage it means that water pump 3 is the damaged pump, otherwise if water\npump 4 has water shortage then pump 4 is the damaged one (total time = 7).StatementSubmissions\nN\nM S\nNMSN 1M\nS\n2≤N≤104\n0≤M≤1 000\n0≤S≤1 000\nM=1S=2\n WORKSPACE / SUBMIT SummaryTasksScoreboard SubmissionsChat Rank 475 / 29037 (Score: 5727.47)  "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "import math\n\nn, m, s = map(int, input().split())\n\n# This is very similar to binary search.\n# Worst case happens when the last pump is the broken one.\n# Then total time to repair is log2(n - 1) * s\n# Total time to travel is (n - 1) * m\n\n# If the pump in working properly, we go downhill.

Power supply to rooms is controlled by one master switch on each ﬂoor. By design, power is supplied to all the rooms on a ﬂoor if and only if the master switch of that ﬂoor is on.\nHowever due to the electrician's mistake in wiring, some rooms have incorrect wiring and their power is supplied the other way around. A room with incorrect wiring receives power if and only if the master switch of its ﬂoor is oﬀ.\nThere can be both correctly and incorrectly wired rooms on a same ﬂoor. For example, consider a ﬂoor has  rooms with correct wiring and  rooms with incorrect wiring. If the master switch of that ﬂoor is on,  rooms will have power and \nrooms will not have power. If the master switch is oﬀ, then,  rooms will not have power and  rooms will have power.\nThe company does not want to spend extra money to ﬁx the wiring mistake.

After you do this, Jerry plays the game on his own: he keeps switching\nlights on and oﬀ until he's satisﬁed with the result and declares victory.\nAlthough you really don't understand your brother's game, you've noticed three important things:\nSome initial conﬁgurations are easier than others for Jerry to solve. So, once in a while you pick a hard conﬁguration that keeps Jerry busy for a longer time.\nIf a conﬁguration is hard, so are all of its rotations. A rotation of a conﬁguration is what you get by rotating the lights that are turned on by some angle that is a multiple of .\nJerry remembers the conﬁgurations he's already played, so if you ﬁnd a hard one, you cannot directly reuse it. He somehow remembers the combinations of the colors. However, you can still trick your brother by using a rotation, as long as\nthe result is a conﬁguration that he hasn't previously seen.\nYou just found a new hard conﬁguration that kept Jerry busy for one hour straight! Assuming that Jerry had not played any of this conﬁguration's rotations before, how many such rotations can you use to keep Jerry busy?\nStandard input\nThe ﬁrst line will contain two space-separated positive integer numbers,  and : the number of lights that are turned on in the initial conﬁguration and the total number of lights.\nThe second line will contain  space-separated integer numbers, the positions of the lights that are turned on. These numbers will be in the range  and will be provided in strictly ascending order. (In our examples, we make the arbitrary\nassumptions that position  is in the north and that positions increase clockwise.)\nStandard output\nYour program must print a single line containing a single integer number: how many diﬀerent rotations of the initial conﬁguration exist.\nConstraints\n.\nFor  of the test data, .\nFor  of the test data, .\nFor  of the test data,  and .\nFor  of the test data,  and .\nFigure of Sample Test 0\nFigure of Sample Test 1\nFigure of Sample Test 2\nInput Output Explanation\n2 5\n1 34 In this example,  and in the initial conﬁguration only the blue and\norange lights are turned on.

There are three more rotations, as shown below.\nHowever, only the ﬁrst rotation (for ) is diﬀerent.

Both dice have six faces valued from  to . Initially, Alice has die  and Bob has die . They both start with an initial score of zero. One game consists of  rounds. In\none round, Alice and Bob roll their own dice at the same time, and add the rolled value to their own score, so that each player's score tracks the sum of all the values rolled by the player in this game. After a roll, if Alice's and Bob's scores are not\nequal, they will exchange their dice before the next round -- This is to avoid cheating in case one of the dice is rigged.\nUnfortunately, one of the two dice is indeed rigged. With a normal die, each value from  to  has a uniform probability to face up. However, the rigged die has a probability of  to roll a , while the values from  to  each have a probability of\n to face up.\nGiven the values that Alice and Bob rolled in a game, can you identify which die is rigged?\nStandard input\nThe ﬁrst line contains a single integer , the number of games. The die that is rigged in each game is independently selected.\nEach game starts with a single integer  on a single line, the number of rounds. This is followed by  lines each having two integers between  and : the value that Alice rolled, and the value that Bob rolled in one round.\nStandard output\nFor each game output a single integer.

Alice and Bob have kept track of their own scores and exchanged dice when required by the rule. Because of those exchanges, Alice and Bob may roll diﬀerent dice in\ndiﬀerent rounds of the game.\nFor each test ﬁle, your solution is judged correct if it identiﬁes the rigged dice correctly in at least  of the games.\nYou must output either  or  for each game.

Both Alice and Bob\nhave a score of  after the second roll so they did not exchange their\ndice.

If a character is present in the text, we should follow the \"YES\" branch of the tree. However, if a character is not present, it may be because it is simply not present in the phrase. Therefore, the language might be in either the\n\"YES\" or the \"NO\" branch of the tree.\nYour task in this challenge is to determine the language that might be used based on a simpler type of decision tree.\nStandard input\nThe ﬁrst line of input contains two space-separated integers , where  is the number of nodes in the decision tree, and  is the number of phrases that we must analyze.\nThe next  lines describe a node in a tree.\nIf the node is an internal node, it will have the following format: I [id] [character] [YES_id] [NO_id], where [id] is an integer that uniquely identiﬁes the node, [character] is a single character, [YES_ID] is the id of the child node on the \"YES\" branch, and [NO_id] is the id of the child node on the \"NO\" branch. The presence or absence of\n[character] in a phrase determines which branch or branches you should follow.\nIf the node is a leaf node, it will have the following format: L [id] [language], where [id] is an integer that uniquely identiﬁes the node, and [language] is the name of the language in the leaf.\nThe next  lines contain phrases that should be analyzed.\nStandard output\nFor each phrase, output a list of languages that the phrase could be using, according to the decision tree.

If Chuck buys dinner for Alice and Dave buys dinner for Bob, then everyone has paid for the same number of dinners as they have received.\nFor each input, you must calculate:\nThe minimum number of meals that must be bought on behalf of another individual so that everyone has received the same number of dinners that they paid for.\nThe minimum number of days that it will take to reach the point that no one has paid for more dinners than they have eaten, given that a person can eat at most one dinner per day. Note that a person can buy any number of dinners for others on a single day.\nStandard input\nThe ﬁrst line of input contains a single integer , the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with an integer , which gives the number of meals that have been occurred.\nEach of the following  lines describes a meal. The ﬁrst value is a string that gives the name of the person who paid for the meal. Then there is an integer  which gives the number of other people who ate at that dinner.
